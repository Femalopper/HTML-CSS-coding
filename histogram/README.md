# Histogram

## Description

The example of creating the histogram, based on table HTML coding.
The histogram is a table in terms of HTML coding. This is an important point - if the styles do not load, then all the information will be displayed in the form of a table, and it can be read. This behavior would be nearly impossible in a collection of other structures.
